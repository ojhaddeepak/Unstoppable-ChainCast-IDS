# Pitch Slides Content — ChainCast-IDS

Slide 1 — Title
- ChainCast-IDS
- Tagline: A Blockchain Intrusion Detection & Stability Forecasting Platform
- Team: Your names

Slide 2 — Problem
- Blockchains face congestion, manipulated gas, and attacks.
- Operators lack forecasting + IDS combined into one lightweight tool.

Slide 3 — Solution
- Monitor live chain metrics, forecast near-term conditions, detect attacks with rule-based and ML detectors.
- Log critical incidents immutably on-chain for audit.

Slide 4 — Demo
- Quick CLI demo: `python -m src.main --node example` shows stability score and alert.
- Live demo: show dashboard (stability score, chart, alerts timeline).

Slide 5 — Architecture
- Single-slide diagram: collectors → ingestion → processing (rules + ML) → dashboard + on-chain logging.
- Mention tech stack (FastAPI, Next.js, ethers.js, scikit-learn).

Slide 6 — Traction & Roadmap
- MVP features done: collectors, rule-engine, stability score, dashboard MVP.
- Next: ML retraining pipeline, multi-network support, integrations.

Slide 7 — Ask
- Mentors/judges: feedback, access to testnet funds, or potential project collaborators.

Slide 8 — Contact / Repo
- Repo: github.com/<your-org>/chaincast-ids
- Quickstart in README; demo command and pitch.md available.

Speaker notes: keep demo under 3 minutes; emphasize novelty (forecast + IDS + on-chain evidence).
